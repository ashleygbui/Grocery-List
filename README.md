# Grocery List Application

## Overview

The Grocery List Application is a web-based tool designed to facilitate collaboration on compiling a shopping list. Users can add or delete items to their list, and these changes are reflected in both their personal list and the main list visible to all users. The application aims to streamline the process of organizing shopping lists, making it easy for multiple users to contribute and stay up-to-date.

## Features

- **User Grid:** Displays the user's personal grocery list.
- **Main Grid:** Displays the main grocery list visible to all users.
- **Add Item:** Users can add new items to their list.
- **Delete Item:** Users can remove items from their list.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction:** Users interact with the application through a user-friendly interface.
2. **Grid Display:** The application displays two grids - one for the user's list and another for the main list.
3. **Adding Items:** Users can add new items to their list by providing the item name, section, and quantity.
4. **Deleting Items:** Users can remove items from their list by selecting the item and clicking the delete button.
5. **Real-Time Updates:** Changes made to the user's list are instantly reflected in the main list, ensuring all users have access to the latest information.

## Future Improvements

- **Real-Time Updates:** Implement real-time fetching of the main data grid during each action, eliminating the need for manual refreshes.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Implement TDD practices to ensure code quality and reliability.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Add authentication and authorization mechanisms to support multiple users and ensure data privacy and security.
- **Session Management:** Implement session management to enhance user experience and provide personalized features.
- **Optimized CRUD Operations:** Refactor CRUD operations to update each data grid individually, improving efficiency and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, Material-UI
- **Backend:** Python, Quart framework
- **API:** RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations
- **Additional Libraries:** marshmallow for serialization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from [GitHub Repo URL].
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install` (for frontend) and `pip install -r requirements.txt` (for backend).
3. Run the application using `npm start` (for frontend) and `python app.py` (for backend).
4. Access the application through the provided URL.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the application URL in your web browser.
2. Add or delete items to your personal grocery list.
3. Observe real-time updates in the main grocery list.
4. Collaborate with other users to compile and manage the shopping list.

With more time, I would focus on enhancing the user experience, improving security measures, and optimizing performance to create a robust and scalable application.

Thank you for this opportunity and would love any feed back or adice on improving this application.
